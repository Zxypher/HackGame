text-based hacker adventure game

main info storyline w/ big companies to hack for vital info
hacking consists of using functions to access and stay connected long enough to get the information needed. if caught, the connection is terminated and they can no longer access that location

turn based, security takes a turn and player takes a turn
security has three turns after process activated to get user's IP, once it has the full IP it will shut that IP down. if proxy'd, only get 1/3 of the real user IP after disconnecting proxy

'hub' level gives a shop to get new/better functions, passwords, proxy's, locations, re-access locations by paying off other hackers to reset your proxy setting

encrypted files = story
access logs = passwords and proxy's
transaction logs = money

Story : resentful ex-employee bent on taking down corrupt company


money system	---
   ideas

getting transaction logs nets money, and spending it in the hub will give you better stuff
bigger companies hide their logs well, but pay out huge
smaller companies don't have much security, but they don't have much in terms of money

   ideas

security, after being alerted, will attempt to find your IP, it takes three turns
if frozen v2, will take one turn more to find the IP
if proxy'd, after the third turn, security resets 
disconnect before security disconnects you, you can come back. 
security force-disconnects you, you'll need to pay off another hacker to get back in



skill system	---
   ideas

* = starting with
*ping	- find available paths
*getInfo- get passwords, files, and money; get info on the current location/chosen location
*access	- move to a location/safely pass a firewall(requires a password)
 crack	- force through a firewall and alert security, tough firewalls need a password
 proxy	- dodge a security shutdown, resets location, if a special IP  is found, can login under that proxy for less security hassle (better than being locked out perm, 3 uses before IP ban)
 freeze	- stop security from locking you out, stops you from doing any timed actions
 disconnect - stop all actions, lose all progress, security resets

   application

location system	---
   ideas

3 levels of access

-10 locations-

-tutorial area 'testing server'
-hub - shop, safe zone to connect to other areas, hint system

5 main storyline missions
-Company's grunt terminal
-Company's research terminal
-Company's security terminal
-Company CEO terminal
-Government terminal

3 side missions
-friend's terminal
-antihacker's terminal

obstacles	---
   ideas

security - end connection if under alert, notified by 'there's an antivirus scanning that folder'
firewalls - no access unless cracked or accessed with password, 3 levels of access
	passwords - 'Keys' interchangeable except based on access level. lv 1 keys only on lv 1 firewalls, etc.
shortcuts - 'wallmasters,' send you to another folder in the location (often backwards, sometimes forwards)
